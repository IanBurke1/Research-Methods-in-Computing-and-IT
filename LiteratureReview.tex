\section{Introduction}
Blockchain is the driving force behind the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin. A blockchain is a digital ledger that is distributed across a network of nodes, each node acquiring an updated copy of the ledger. The ledger contains a list of all transactions that have been executed on the network. All transactions are verified by consensus of the network with a cryptographic audit trail maintained and validated by multiple nodes. The distributed ledger is immutable. It can be updated by adding new sets of transactions but it cannot be changed, erased or mutated any further. Every transaction can be viewed on the public ledger, but the identity of participating parties behind every transaction is kept hidden. Blockchain uses a peer-to-peer network [1] meaning there is no central authority in control of the system. Therefore, creating a decentalised environment. E-commerce on the internet relies heavily on financial institutions as trusted intermediaries or third parties to process and mediate electronic transactions. This system is not ideal with a high chance of fraudulent activity and high transaction costs. The whole security of the system is based on a trust model [1]. Blockchain allows parties to transact directly to each other without the involvement of a trusted intermediary or third party i.e. there is no middleman needed. This leads to faster and cost effective transactions. The system is secured using asymmetric cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
\\\\ Since the emergence of Bitcoin, a lot of attention began to circulate around blockchain and the capabilities the technology can provide beyond cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is capable of disrupting industries like business and finance to state governance and giving empowerment to people in a decentralised fashion [4]. Blockchain applications such as distributed cloud storage, digital identity, digital voting and decentralised notary are currently being developed [7]. The introduction of smart contracts as another blockchain component allow us to prove ownership of a digital property or any asset of value. Physical assets such as a house, car or smartphone or non-physical assets such as company shares can be implemented with smart contracts. Since the blockchain is a distributed ledger, it can also store a proof of existence of legal documents, health records, personal identity, notary i.e. document certification and private securities. A sense of anonymity and privacy can be achieved by storing the fingerprint of digital assets. 
\\\\ The paper is structured as follows: In section II, we will examine how blockchain works and the introduction smart contracts. In section III, we will discuss economic implications of blockchain and how it can revolutionize the world. In the final section we will present our overall conclusion of the emerging technology.

\section{How does it work}
 Blockchain was first introduced with Bitcoin to solve the double-spending problem [1],[5]. A blockchain uses a peer-to-peer network which is comprised of interconnected nodes that share resources among each other without the use of a centralized administrator that controls the system i.e. a decentralised system. Instead of using a middleman to carry out a transaction, the Bitcoin blockchain uses cryptography to verify and validate transactions [1]. When one party wants to send Bitcoin to another party, each transaction is signed with a digital signature, to ensure the authentication of both parties. The sender owns a private key and sends out a public key which the receiver uses to verify the owner. Each transaction is broadcasted to all nodes across the network and verified by a consensus i.e. majority of nodes agree on a transaction. Verified transactions are placed into blocks with each block containing a set of transactions. A set of transactions in one block are considered to have occurred at the same time [6]. Once a block is validated through cryptographic proof-of-work, it is then timestamped and giving a hash i.e. a reference of the previous block. Each validated block is linked to each other in a linear, chronological order, hence the name blockchain. A new block is added roughly every ten minutes after a node solves the mathematical problem [6]. This helps reduce the probability that a block will be generated more than once at a given time. A consensus is made about the ordering of blocks. Nodes that participate in generating proof-of-work are called miners. The miners use their CPU power to solve these mathematical puzzles. Each miner competes with each other to complete the proof-of-work and thus add a newly mined block to the chain in order to be awarded Bitcoin as an incentive [1].  
 
 \subsection{Smart Contracts}
 The concept of smart contracts was first introduced in 1994 by Nick Szabo. The idea was never implemented until the emergence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. According to Szabo, a smart contract is "a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises" [8]. 
\subsection{Peer-to-Peer Network}
A distributed network  Users can establish a connection point on the blockchain via any node on the network. Users engage with the blockchain using public and private keys. A private key is used to verify their own transaction while the public key is used to broadcast the transaction to the network. Each node collects and validates a transaction. Once a transaction is validated by nodes i.e. miners, it is then timestamped and placed in a block. The block is verified by nodes to see that all transactions in that block are valid before it can be accepted and placed on the chain. A block containing invalid transactions will then be discarded by the nodes. Lets say nodes broadcast different variations of a block at the same time
\subsection{Security}
The Bitcoin Blockchain is secured using cryptographic algorithms and protocols such as hashing and asymmetric private/public keys. For instance, a private key is used to create a digital signature for each transaction a user broadcasts to the network. The digital signature is used to authenticate that the transaction belongs to the user and also prevents data corruption and manipulation from attackers. The private key is anonymous while the public key is used as proof that the transaction belongs to the particular user. 
\subsection{Distributed Data Storage}
\subsection{Decentralization}

\section{Implications of Blockchain}
Smart contracts can be programmed to ensure that all transactions adhere to the proposed legal agreements and the records managed by blockchain are properly maintained with respect to the underlying legal agreements expressed by these records. Smart contracts can be paired with a blockchain to record changes of asset ownership under contract terms. A smart contract can act as a wrapper for any transaction that automatically executes the terms of a contract. Government services can be improved efficiently and transparently with smart contracts via blockchain by automating laws and statutes.[8] With a blockchain in place, systems can be resilient and operated on decentralised networks that do not depend on a central server which could lead to failure for the whole system. Blockchain systems can ensure accurate and identical records for contracting parties due to immutable and transparent transactions. 

Stock trading with the implementation of a blockchain is another possibility. Public companies can directly issue shares to investors via blockchain. Shares can be purchased or sold through blockchain. This could disrupt stock brokers, exchanges and banks. 

Since the introduction of cloud computing, we have popular cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox and One Drive that can store our documents, multimedia and any other files. However, cloud storage services face many challenges in areas such as security, privacy and data control. We put our trust in these third parties over the handling of our personal files. Storj is a open source cloud storage project that is implementing blockchain technology to offer completely decentralised and end to end encrypted cloud storage which will give users a sense of security and integrity.

With the Internet of Things (IOT) becoming increasingly popular technology, there is still a centralised model being used on majority of IOT systems. In some situations, devices need to communicate and exchange data autonomously. Efforts have been made to implement decentralised systems to bring a level of security and trust for the exchange of data. Blockchain can keep record of messages and data exchanged between devices on IOT platforms. IBM and Samsung have teamed up to develop a Autonomous Decentralised Peer-to-Peer Telemetry (ADEPT) platform that uses blockchain components to establish decentralised IOT. BitTorrent's file sharing, smart contracts and TeleHash (peer-to-peer messaging) are protocols being used to develop the platform. 

Governments and large corporations control majority of DNS servers which can lead to censorship being enforced on users. Namecoin is an open sourced blockchain technology that implements decentralised version of DNS. This lets every user to have the same DNS phonebook data on their computers.

\subsection{Blockchain drawbacks}
Blockchain shows great potential with a wide range of applications that can improve and benefit a number of sectors in various industries. However, with rapid innovation and change comes resistance. It is in peoples behaviour to resist change. Blockchain technology brings a number of changes and disruption to businesses, governance and society. One of these disruptions is the removal of trusted intermediaries and third parties like financial institutions. Customers will have to trust that their electronic transactions are safe, secured and completed. Government and politics may slow down the blockchain hype train by bringing in new laws and regulations. Blockchain offers anonymity which gives criminals an advantage to launder money or buy illegal products online using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With Future advancement of quantum computing, cryptographic keys may be easier to crack. Nonetheless, this argument is only valid until the hash keys become bigger and even more stronger.
