\section{Introduction}
In 2009, the world was first introduced to Bitcoin, a decentralized digital cash system where parties can complete transactions directly with one another without a middleman or an intermediary. The driving force behind Bitcoin is Blockchain, a distributed ledger that contains a list of completed transactions and stores them in blocks which are validated by nodes on the network. This technology is revolutionising not just for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but for future applications in finance, personal data, health care and the government. Bitcoin was designed and created by an unknown person or group of persons which used the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Huge interest began to circulate around Blockchain technology and the impact it can have in the future for society. In this review, I will discuss the implications of the Blockchain technology on the economy and the impact it can have on society.
