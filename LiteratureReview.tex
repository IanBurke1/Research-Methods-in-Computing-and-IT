\section{Introduction}
In 2009, the world was first introduced to Bitcoin, a decentralized digital cash system where parties can complete transactions directly with one another without a middleman or an intermediary. No one knows who created Bitcoin, their true identity is unknown although the person or group of persons have used an online alias, Satoshi Nakamoto. The cryptocurrency is now used worldwide. The driving force behind Bitcoin is Blockchain, a distributed ledger that contains a list of completed transactions and stores them in blocks which are validated by nodes on the network. Each validated block is timestamped and chained together to increase security and to eliminate fraud, hence the name "Blockchain". This technology is revolutionising not just for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but for other future applications in industries such as finance, health care, social and the government sector. Smart contracts is also another popular topic associated with Blockchains. These digital contracts are self executing which are a which are used in the blockchain to enable people to exchange money, stocks, property and other potential assets. A Blockchain offers a sense of security and privacy to users thanks to its cryptographic algorithms. Another key feature of blockchains are smart contracts.  In this review, I will discuss the implications of the Blockchain technology on the economy and how it can solve real world problems.
