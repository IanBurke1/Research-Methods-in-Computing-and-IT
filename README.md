## Abstract
The term 'revolutionize' is being thrown around when it comes to Blockchain, the underlying technology of Bitcoin, a technology that has evolved beyond cryptocurrencies in recent years that offers potential capabilities such as smart contracts and decentralised applications that may or perhaps impact society and disrupt many industries in the future. Blockchain allows people to interact with each other whether it be exchanging digital currency or ownership of property by establishing trust without the involvement of a trusted intermediary in a secure manner using the highest level of cryptography. In this review, we will examine the functionality of blockchain and embark on the possibilities it can provide along with various obstacles it faces in the long run. Our conclusion is that blockchain shows great promise to businesses and society with decentralised applications, however it would take a considerable amount of time before we see the true power of the technology come into effect with many obstacles to overcome such as government regulation and adaptability of change for businesses.
